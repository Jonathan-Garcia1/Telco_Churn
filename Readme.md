# Telco Churn

# Description
In the rapidly evolving telecommunications industry, understanding and mitigating customer churn has become a critical business concern. This data science project aims to analyze customer churn patterns using historical data and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. By doing so, this project aims to provide actionable insights to Telco, enabling them to implement targeted retention strategies.

# Goals

* Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean Telco customer data to create a comprehensive dataset suitable for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory analysis to identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations related to customer churn.
* Feature Importance Determination: Employ machine learning techniques to assess the importance of various features in predicting churn, aiding in identifying critical factors.
* Model Building and Evaluation: Develop predictive models for customer churn, compare their performance, and select the most effective one for accurate churn prediction.

# Initial Thoughts

My initial hypothesis is that customers who are relatively new, have certain services enabled or disabled, and are on specific contract types might have higher churn rates.

# The Plan: Telco Churn Analysis

* ## Data Acquisition and Preparation

    * Obtain the Telco customer data from the codeup server.
    * Examine data for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    * Encode categorical variables and transform any necessary features for analysis.
    * Create new engineered features to potentially capture patterns related to churn.

* ## Exploratory Data Analysis:

    * Visualize churn rates to understand the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
    * Explore the impact of individual features (e.g., tenure, monthly charges) on churn rates.
    * Investigate correlations between service-related features and churn behavior.
    * Analyze the distribution of contract types, internet service types, and payment methods for insights.
    * Identify potential segments based on customer demographics and services used.

* ## Hypotheses Testing and Initial Questions:

    * Test hypotheses regarding factors influencing churn based on EDA insights.
    * Address initial questions:
        * What is the overall churn rate?
        * How does tenure relate to churn?
        * Are certain services correlated with higher/lower churn?
        * Do customers on different contract types have different churn behaviors?

* ## Feature Importance and Model Development:

    * Use findings from EDA and hypotheses testing to select relevant features.
    * Develop predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) using appropriate libraries.
    * Evaluate models using cross-validation techniques on the training and validation sets.

* ## Model Selection and Evaluation:

    * Compare model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the validation data.
    * Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics and insights gained.

* ## Model Testing and Generalization:

    * Evaluate the selected model on the test dataset to ensure its generalizability.
    * Interpret the model's predictions and analyze its strengths and limitations.

* ## Conclusion and Recommendations:

    * Summarize the findings, insights, and correlations discovered during the analysis.
    * Provide recommendations for Telco based on the factors identified as influencing churn.
    * Highlight actionable steps that Telco could take to reduce churn rates.
